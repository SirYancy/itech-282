## What is a computer?

* What is a computer?
    * Examples
    * Difference between *general-purpose* and *specific-purpose*
    * Embedded Systtems
* Three major components:
    * Hardware
    * Operating System
    * Applications
* Hardware
    * Examples
* Operating System
    * Controls hardware
    * Gives an interface (UI)
        * UI vs GUI
* Applications
    * Specialized tasks

        * Word Processors, Video games, etc
    * You can add new applications to extend the functionality.
* Stages - The *computing process*. (At a very basic level)
    * Input
        * Examples?
    * Processing
        * What does this part?
    * Output

* Often there are now two other stages:
    * Data Storage
    * Network Connection
* Why?
    * If you understand how computers work *in general*, you can more easily adapt when confronted with a problem on a strange computer.
* Breaking it down
    1. Power up. (Computers need electricity)
    1. Processing parts prepare for action
    1. You provide input
    1. Processing parts process your command
    1. Processing parts send output information to your output devices
    1. Output devices show or play the results to you
    1. Repeat 3-6 until you are satisfied
    1. Save your work
    1. Power down the computer.

## Hardware

* Typical computer. What components are there? 
    * System unit (case)
    * Monitor (visual output)
    * speakers (audio output)
    * Mouse/Keyboard (input)
    * Multifunction device (printer/scanner)
* Often called a workstation
